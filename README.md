# Javier Marín Almagro - Fullstack Web Developer

## About me
I am a junior web developer, focused on working with the MERN stack. I have worked on project both on the Front and Back end, being the front end the part that interests me the most at the moment. Teamwork has been the scope most of the time, always relying on Git and agile methodologies, although I have also developed individual projects.
